# BIDASH

Hi Guys,

I am trying to create some python projects.
I think the best approach is combination of books and online courses with support from stack overflow.
I love all Head First Series books such as Object Oriented Design, Java, Design Patterns, Python and others.
Also I found some paid courses in Udemy are better options than free versions
MOOCs like Coursera, EDx are also useful in certain area.
Pluralsight courses are useful for all round tech knowledge
Datacamp courses are nice address niche area that others don't get into.

In summary get general idea from books and MOOCs. Then chose paid specific course of your interest.
